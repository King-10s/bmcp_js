# Dedication
I dedicate this chess program to my YouTube subscribers and all chess programming enthusiasts
looking rather for minimalist implementation than playing strength.

# YouTube tutorial series on the engine used in this program
Originally I've written bmcp in C - here's the tutorial series, explaining the chess playing algorithm.
The program's design allows you to easily convert C version to javascript. Have fun!
